Private IPv4 address blocks are 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (10/8), 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255.255 (172.16/8), and 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16)
/27 mask has 5 host bits: 2^5 − 2 = 30 hosts. The bit-number representation of 255.255.255.248 (256-248 = 2^3=> 32-3=29) is /29
A /26 (255.255.255.(256-2^6=192) mask has 26 network bits and 6 host bits 
Upper-layer protocols are identified in the IP header’s Protocol field. TCP is protocol 6, and UDP is protocol 17.
Loopback addresses should have a /32 mask so that address space is not wasted.
The precedence bits are in the ‘Type of Service’ field of the IPv4 header.
Multicast addresses range from 224.0.0.1 to 239.255.255.255.
150.10.192.0/21 (2^3 from /24) summarizes subnetworks from 150.10.192.0/24 to 150.10.199.0/24. 
Point-to-point links need only two host addresses. They use a /30 mask, which provides 2^2 − 2 = 2 host addresses.
DHCP assigns IP addresses dynamically. DHCP can be used to specify several host IP configuration parameters, including IP address, mask, default gateway, DNS servers, and TFTP server.
The minimum size of an IPv4 header is 20 bytes, without any option.
Static NAT is used to statically translate public IP addresses to private IP addresses.
NAT uses different IP addresses for translations. PAT uses different port numbers to identify translations
The DS field of DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point) allocates 6 bits in the Type of Service (ToS) field, thus making it capable of 64 distinct codepoints.
The header checksum field only includes a checksum of the IP header; it does not check the data portion.
The subnet is 172.56.4.0/22, the address range is from 172.56.4.1 to 172.56.7.254, network address 172.56.4.0, Subnet Mask: /22 (255.255.(256-2^2=252).0) and the subnet broadcast is 172.56.7.255.
When packets are fragmented at the network layer, the fragments get reassembled at the IP layer in the destination host.
DHCP can be used to configure the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and other optional parameters.
Class B networks have 16 bits for host addresses with the default mask: 2^16 − 2 = 65,534.
192.170.20.16/30 => .16 to .19 and 92.170.20.20/30 => .20 to .23 can be summarized by 192.170.20.16/29 => .16 to .23
AF3 is backward compatible with IP precedence priority traffic with a binary of 011.
IPv4 packets can be fragmented by the sending host and routers.
Multicast addresses are received by a set of hosts subscribed to the multicast group.
The three types of IPv4 address are unicast, broadcast, and multicast.
End-user workstations, Cisco IP phones, and mobile devices should have their IP addresses assigned dynamically.
Dynamic name resolution reduces administrative overhead. Name-to-IP address tables do not need to be configured.
/28 leaves 4 bits to determine the number of host addresses: 2^4 − 2 = 16 − 2 = 14.
E-commerce, Internet connection and Remote access/VPN are examples where private IPv4 address space can’t be used
PAT technology allows a company to use a single public IP address when using private IPv4 addresses in the internal LAN
RIPE is European RIR (Regional Internet Registry)
VLSM allows you to divide address blocks into subnets of different sizes
ARIN (American Registry for Internet Numbers) for North America allocates IP address blocks for the United States, Canada, several parts of the Caribbean region, and Antarctica.
APNIC (Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre) for the Asia-Pacific region allocates IP address blocks for Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and neighboring countries.
172.16.45.227/27 (256 – 2^5=224) resides in subnet 172.16.45.224.
